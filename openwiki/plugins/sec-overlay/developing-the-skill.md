# Developing the sec-overlay skill

All commands below run from `skills/sec-overlay/helpers/`.

## Test and lint commands

```bash
uv run pytest -q                                   # full suite (2 env-only failures, see below)
uv run pytest tests/test_fingerprint.py -q         # single file
uv run pytest tests/test_x.py::test_name           # single test
uv run ruff check sec_overlay/ bench/ tests/       # lint (line-length 100)
uv run ruff format sec_overlay/ bench/ tests/
uv run ty check                                    # static types
uv run python -m sec_overlay.preflight             # tool availability
```

The suite is 81 pytest files, 595 tests (helpers/README.md's Test coverage & contracts
section). Two failures on a clean checkout are environmental, not code defects — see
[running an audit](running-an-audit.md#environment-prerequisites-for-a-full-run) for exactly
which tests and why.

## The stdlib-only rule

The core has **no runtime dependencies** in `pyproject.toml` — only dev deps (`pytest`, `ruff`,
`ty`). External SAST binaries are shelled out to, never imported. "Do not add a dependency
without a strong justification and user sign-off" (skill `CLAUDE.md` §7). This is a design
constraint the [tool-receipt gate](helpers.md#the-tool-receipt-gate) and the rest of the
deterministic core depend on staying auditable and portable.

## TDD and the structural guard tests

New or changed executable logic ships with a test in the same change (root `CLAUDE.md`'s
repo-wide rule: Python under `helpers/tests/`, shell scripts get a colocated invocation test —
see [commit governance](../../governance/hooks-and-commits.md)). Four tests specifically guard
against silent drift rather than testing one module's behavior:

| Test | Guards against |
|---|---|
| `test_contracts.py` | Prompt↔schema drift — a `Finding` JSON example embedded in an agent prompt must parse against the real `models.py` |
| `test_finding_schema.py` | `models.py`'s `Finding` record staying consistent with `references/finding.schema.json` |
| `test_wiring.py` | silent-backend regressions, `clsmap` routing gaps, dead links between `attack-classes.md` and its `hunting/` companions, and that `classes/*.md` prompts carry the proof tuple + anti-collapse rule |
| `test_docs_invariants.py` | documentation contracts — `prompt-constants.md` block presence, `finding-template.md` section structure, agent-prompt rules (determinism, tool-receipt trust, evidence chains) |

Keep all four green when touching a schema, a class-routing table, or an agent prompt's
structure — they are how prompt↔code drift gets caught before it reaches a real audit.

## The bench harness (dev-only, not part of an audit)

`helpers/bench/` measures and locks detection quality; it is never invoked during a real scan.
A labelled corpus (positives to find, negatives to stay silent on; `corpus_seed/` is seeded
from real findings and is gitignored — see
[running an audit](running-an-audit.md#environment-prerequisites-for-a-full-run)) is scanned
via a swappable adapter, judged, and scored for precision/recall by source and class plus an
FP rate. Its **regression gate**: a `locked` finding that stops being detected fails the run.

```bash
python -m bench.run --corpus bench/corpus_seed --run-dir /tmp/bench --workspaces <dir>
```

## The semgrep rules submodule

`helpers/rules/semgrep/` is a git submodule. Clone this repository with `--recurse-submodules`,
or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` afterward — see
[running an audit](running-an-audit.md#environment-prerequisites-for-a-full-run) for the test
that fails without it.

## The folder-README-tracks-code rule, inside this skill

The repo-wide [doc-update-guard hook](../../governance/hooks-and-commits.md) requires a
folder's `README.md` to be staged whenever a file inside that folder changes, for every folder
that has a *tracked* `README.md` — no skill-specific exception. Inside
`skills/sec-overlay/`, that reaches:

- [`agents/README.md`](/plugins/sec-overlay/skills/sec-overlay/agents/README.md) — every LLM
  prompt: role, model tier, inputs/outputs, the gate ladder, the `classes/` extensions.
- [`helpers/README.md`](/plugins/sec-overlay/skills/sec-overlay/helpers/README.md) — the ~70
  Python modules grouped by job, the CLI-callable list, the finding schema contract.
- [`references/README.md`](/plugins/sec-overlay/skills/sec-overlay/references/README.md) — the
  rule book: the 12 prompt-constants blocks, schemas, crypto YAMLs.
- Plus the nested folder READMEs one level deeper:
  `helpers/sec_overlay/README.md`, `helpers/tests/README.md`, `helpers/bench/README.md`,
  `helpers/rules/README.md`, `references/asvs/README.md`, `references/codeguard/README.md`,
  `references/hunting/README.md`.

The skill's own [`CLAUDE.md`](/plugins/sec-overlay/skills/sec-overlay/CLAUDE.md) §8 states the
policy in human terms: these READMEs "over-explain what lives there and how it works, with
mermaid diagrams and worked flows... the entry point for a person (not just an LLM)". A
skill-local script, `.githooks/pre-commit`, also documents part of this same rule but is not
the mechanism that actually enforces it — see
[commit governance](../../governance/hooks-and-commits.md#a-second-non-primary-hook-inside-the-sec-overlay-skill)
for why the repo-root prek hook is the one that matters.
